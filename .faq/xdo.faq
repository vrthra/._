What is xdotool?
This tool lets you programatically (or manually) simulate keyboard input and mouse activity, move and resize windows, etc. It does this using X11's XTEST extension and other Xlib functions

Example: focus the firefox url bar
WID=`xdotool search "Mozilla Firefox" | head -1`
xdotool windowfocus $WID
xdotool key ctrl+l
