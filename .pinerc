# For a variable to be unset its value must be null/blank.  This is not the

# "unset" a variable that has a default or previously assigned value.
# To set a variable to the empty string its value should be "".
# Switch variables are set to either "yes" or "no", and default to "no".
# Except for feature-list items, which are additive, values set in the
# .pinerc file replace those in pine.conf, and those in pine.conf.fixed
# over-ride all others.  Features can be over-ridden in .pinerc or
